First Week Summary:
My Learning Outcomes: 
Developing and utilizing custom Java classes (the `Car` class with methods).
Creating reusable techniques (for example, Fibonacci and factorial).
Using `StringBuilder` to manipulate strings for palindrome and reversal tests.
The `add`, `commit`, `push`, and proper commit practices are basic Git commands.

Challenges Faced:Â 
Comprehending parameter management and method reusability.
Preventing runtime mistakes and guaranteeing input validity.
Recalling Java syntax for console input, classes, and methods.

Introspection & Advancements:
Enhance the readability of the code by adding better formatting and comments.
To handle faulty inputs, provide exception handling.
Examine JUnit tests to confirm the results of the methods.
For other implementations (Fibonacci, factorial), use recursion.
